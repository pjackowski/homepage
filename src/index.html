                <p>I am a versatile software engineer with <em>10 years of experience in web application development</em> and <em>5 years in information security</em>. I am seeking an opportunity to join an ambitious team to deliver quality and secure products and learn new skills.</p>

                <p>As a teenager, I was interested in game development, OpenGL graphics, and the demoscene computer art subculture. This led me to a degree in Computer Science and later my interest evolved toward <em>web application development</em>. Over the years I have gained expertise in <em>JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails</em>.</p>

                <p>I spent several years in information security working on all aspects of security, including <em>threat modeling</em>, <em>source code review</em>, <em>internal pentesting</em>, and <em>incident response</em>. I assisted the dev and devops teams in <em>web application and cloud infrastructure security</em>. I have developed a unique set of skills well outside of the typical range of skills in a dev team.</p>

                <p>I have a keen interest in <em>working with a team</em>. I am <em>self-motivated and determined to solve problems</em>, and I will look for the information I need to accomplish goals or ask AI for a hint ;] I like to work with <em>well-crafted, tested, and secure code</em> and have a great time doing awesome visuals. It has never been easier to develop web applications!</p>

It was an initiative to deliver a small web application to integrate with a corporate holiday tracking system to replace or supplement the existing tool that had a horrible user experience and was widely considered* as the software equivalent of a torture chamber ;-] From a perspective of time, the expectations about the dwindling rate of enthusiasm of coworkers were underestimated ;-] Such projects aren't well received in larger corporations or rather they are, but the amount of bureaucracy required to do anything is beyond belief, so nothing gets done.

                    <h3>Force based diagram <span class="timestamp">2012</span><span class="tech">JavaScript / Raphael.js</span></h3>

                    <p>Implementation of the force-based algorithm. Did I mention I like physics?! ;-] Position of nodes in the graph depends on the resultant force, a set of forces reduced to a single vector. There are three main forces computed for each node in each step:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>repulsion based on Coulomb's law, as all nodes carry the same charge</li>
                        <li>the resilience of spring connecting nodes based on Hooke's law</li>
                        <li>gravity force which pulls up nodes, so single nodes or separated groups stay fairly close to the centre of mass</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The initial position is random, far from optimum in terms of energy. Such a state is very unstable and once the simulation starts diagram stabilizes. In the end, the graph is very close to its local minimum state of energy. This might not be a global minimum, perfect state, but often is good enough and requires less computation.</p>

                    <p>Energy minimum means that all spring-driven forces are in balance with repulsion electric forces. Nodes aren't moving anymore and kinetic energy is very close to zero. Another important thing is friction. Dampening wastes energy, so simulation stops at some point, otherwise, it would keep moving forever.</p>

                    <p>Each node has a mass, size, and color derived from the input data. In other words, a bigger value is a bigger mass and size of the bubble. The relation between nodes is expressed by the length of the spring, a closer relationship is a shorter spring.</p>

                    <p>Landscape rendering engine. The engine loads height maps and creates 3D landscapes covered with textures. Data such as textures or height maps are loaded from individual, uncompressed files. Parameters of the scene can be changed by command line parameters or during run time. It is a basic rendering engine, with simple physics such as gravity and collision detection. At the time I was proud of it since it involved a lot of relatively complex math and OpenGL magic. The graphic cards weren't as sophisticated as nowadays but had a decent selection of hardware-supported features.</p>

                    <p>I planned to expand the engine into a full RTS (real-time strategy) game, but it still required a lot of work to turn it into a useful project, that is an engine capable of loading complete maps with minimum fine-tuning and customization, like in the proper games of that time. Not to mention, the game would require even more work to be actually playable, such as AI opponents, interacting with the environment, and various content including graphical assets. Instead, I managed to reuse big chunks of the code as a foundation for my final university project, and I learned a ton of things, including quaternions! ;]</p>

                    <h3>The Battle for Wesnoth</h3>

                    <p>I was a Polish translation maintainer and coordinator of the open-source game: <a class="title" href="https://wesnoth.org">The Battle for Wesnoth</a>. It is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy theme. Wesnoth has many different campaigns and scenarios waiting to be played. It is a very mature and stable project, that had been actively developed for over a decade.</p>

                    <p>My contributions are tiny compared to the work of skilled volunteers that had created over years hundreds of beautifully animated units. Artworks are just awesome! ;-]</p>

                <p>Crowd science is a way to distribute a scientific workload to the community of enthusiasts, who analyze the data in a specific way, guided in the project. Usually, there is little to no prior scientific knowledge required and the tasks are narrow in scope. People contribute for a number of reasons and I was participating because it was such a great opportunity to learn and push the boundary of science. Following are some projects I have participated in.</p>

I build and fly radio-controlled models and drones, which naturally leads to electronics, soldering, and DIY in general. I like hiking, and cycling and try to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>I fly radio-controlled, 6-channel helicopters and drones, built either by myself from selected parts or from kits. They are very precise and powerful flying machines and fly in exactly the same way as real helicopters. There are no shortcuts in terms of rotor mechanics, control surfaces, etc.</p>

                    <p>I build foam planes. It is a cheap and simple method of constructing fixed-wing RC aircraft. Models are easy to fix in case of a hard landing and present a little risk due to low weight and density, as well as a soft structural material, which also offers some protection to the internal components. It is relatively easy to shape a good aerodynamic wing profile by sanding the foam.</p>

                    <p>I designed and built a workbench. The 3D model was created in Google SketchUp. It was a very interesting project and the first furniture I have ever made. The bench is very stable and stiff, however, I had to add diagonal supports in order to support the legs, because a 90-degree connection isn't rigid enough. Rookie mistake! ;] Drawer works smoothly, as it is mounted on ball-bearing sliders. The workbench is very handy, especially when I do soldering.</p>
