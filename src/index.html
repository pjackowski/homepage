                <p>I am a <em>software engineer with twelve years of experience</em>, including <em>three years in information security</em>.</p>
                <p>As a teenager, I was interested in <em>game development, OpenGL graphics and demoscene computer art subculture</em>.</p>
                <p>This led me to <em>BSc in Computer Science</em> and later my interest evolved towards <em>front-end web application development</em>. Over the years I have gained some expertise in back-end languages such as <em>Python and Ruby</em>.</p>
                <p>I have spent the last three years in information security working on all aspects of IT security, including <em>cloud security, incident response and infrastructure recon</em>. I have assisted the dev and devops teams in <em>web applications security</em>. This was an interesting experience and I have developed a unique set of skills well outside of the typical range of skills in a dev team.</p>
                <p>I have a keen interest in <em>working with the team and communicating with people</em>. I am <em>self-motivated and determined to solve problems</em>, and I will look for the information I need to accomplish goals.</p>
                <p>I love to work with <em>well crafted, testable and secure code</em> and have a great time doing awesome visuals. It has never been easier to develop web applications!</p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Most of my technical skills are in front-end, while back-end has been secondary so far. I have also picked infosec expertise, but these skills are either too general to list here or tool-specific. I do not want list tools used by previous employers for security reasons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><em>Front-end</em> JavaScript, Angular.js, Knockout.js, jQuery. HTML5, CSS3, SASS/LESS</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Back-end</em> Python, Ruby on Rails</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Databases</em> PostgreSQL, MySQL</p></li>

                    <h3>Snapshot Serengeti</h3>
                    <p>I made these wireframes in my own free time as a proposition of mobile friendly version of <a href="www.snapshotserengeti.org/">Snapshot Serengeti</a> page. It is one of the awesome projects hosted by <a href="www.zooniverse.org">Zooniverse</a>. A lot of people spend hours everyday traveling to work and back home, so it is crucial to let them do science on the go! ;-) I am not an author of original project, which is pretty good by the way! I have only optimized navigation and rearranged layout to be more responsive.</p>

                    <p>I have create these wireframes for Chronos weekend project. It was pretty interesting initiative, as originally we planned to deliver awesome piece of software and replace corporate holiday tracking system - software equivalent of torture chamber ;-) I suggested to do use angular.js and follow modern work flow with grunt and bower. Eventually we could give something back to the community and open-source it, however team lost motivation unexpectedly before any work started ;-)</p>

                    <p>I have used wireframe toolkit from <a href="www.eleqtriq.com/2010/08/sqetch-wireframe-toolkit/">eleqtriq.com</a>. It is really nice!</p>

                    <div class="labels">
                        <span class="label">JavaScript</span>

                    </div>

                    <p>Implementation of force based algorithm. Physics! I love physics! ;-) Position of nodes in the graph depends on the resultant force - set of forces reduced to single vector. There are three main forces computed for each node in each step:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>repulsion based on Coulomb's law, as all nodes carry the same charge</li>
                        <li>resilience of spring connecting nodes based on the Hooke's law</li>
                        <li>gravity force which pulls up nodes, so single nodes or separated groups stay fairly close to the center of mass</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Initial position is random - far from optimum in terms of energy. Such a state is very unstable and once simulation starts diagram stabilizes. At the end of simulation graph is in it's local minimum state of energy, which might not be global minimum (perfect state), but often is good enough. Energy minimum means that all spring driven forces are in balance with repulsion electric forces. Physically nodes are not moving anymore and kinetic energy is zero or almost zero. Another important thing is friction dampening. it wastes energy, so simulation stops, otherwise it would keep moving forever - it is called perpetum mobile ;-)</p>

                    <p>Each node has a mass, size and color depending on it's value read from data set. In other words bigger value - bigger mass and size of bubble. Relation between nodes is expressed by length of spring, closer relation - shorter spring.</p>

                    <p>This is presentation about security I created for my colleagues in Amdocs. Password security is very important, but often disregarded. In general information security does not seem to be important topic for typical developer unfortunately. I decided to share my experience and prepared few slides (actually 137 ;) in my free time.

                    <p>Engine creates 3D landscapes covered with textures and renders simple objects. It loads necessary data such as textures or height maps from uncompressed files. Parameters of scene can be changed by command line parameters. To be honest it is not very powerful software, but that time (2003-2005) I was really proud of it. I planned expand engine into RTS (real time strategy) game. However it never happened. Instead I managed to reuse big chunks as foundation for my final university project (see "Visualization of porous materials" above).</p>

                    <h3>RC models</h3>

                    <p>I have few radio controlled helis. Smaller models came in RTF (ready to fly) packages, but the biggest: 6-channel CopterX-450 were built from kit with mechanical parts only. Electronic equipment was chosen and bought separately. It is very precise, powerful flying machine and it works in the same was as real helicopters, therefore it is not easy to fly. Chinook is actually a toy, stable and friendly. It does not really fly like real heli. Lama V4 is proper 4-channel helicopter with two main rotors, which also makes it very good as first indoor model.</p>

                    <p>I built below depron plane from scratch in autumn 2012. It is cheap and simple model, but I have spent about 4 weeks to cut, glue and assemble it. Partially, because this was my first fixed-wing model, but mostly because plans I downloaded were incomplete. They covered only shapes and sizes of all foam elements, so I had to find the way to put all pieces together. At the moment I am planning to build second one, bigger and more powerful with plenty of electronics installed on board such as AP (Autopilot), OSD (On Screen Display with telemetry), GPS, etc.</p>

It is a turn-based, strategy game with a fantasy theme. Wesnoth has many different campaigns and scenarios waiting to be played. It is very mature and stable project being under development for couple years. Thousands of volunteers created hundreds of beautifully animated units, at least two dozens of balanced races and factions. The world of Wesnoth is absolutely huge and only limited by your creativity. You can make new units, maps and write your own scenarios or even entire campaigns! Game can be played either in single player or multiplayer mode on one machine or over network. There are 16 main line campaigns available and countless single scenarios.</p>

                        <p><a class="title" href="http://www.planethunters.org/">Planet Hunters</a> <em>is all about hunting... extraterrestrial planets.</em> NASA's Kepler spacecraft is one of the most powerful tools in the hunt for extrasolar planets. Unfortunately it has suffered a mechanical failure in 2013, when one more of the reaction wheels stabilizing spacecraft stopped working. Despite fact that instrument might be no longer useful, computers are sifting through the large amount of data already collected. Planet Hunters are betting that there will be planets which can only be found via the remarkable human ability for pattern recognition.</p>

They need your help to classify all the different animals caught in millions of camera trap images collected in Serengeti National Park. Main purpose of project is to understand how various kinds of species can coexist. I find it pretty interesting, mostly because I love animals. This is <em>unique opportuinity to understand their behaviour and learn a lot</em>. Not all pictures are so easy to classify, as you migh think. Sometimes individual spicies are so similar or only fragments are visible.</p>

When it happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby. Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. <em>These gravitational lenses are very rare and difficult to find.</em> Pick your targets and engage!</p>

                    <h3>DIY</h3>

                    <p>I designed and completed below workbench project in 2011. I was not able to find exactly, what I was looking for, so I started thinking about DIY. Once I had rough sketch and I knew what kind of wood was available in local shops, I was ready to create 3D model in Google SketchUp.</p>

                    <p>It was very interesting project and first furniture I have ever made, therefore I have learned a lot. Bench is very stable and stiff, however I had to add diagonal slats in order to support legs.</p>

                    <p>I find this table very handy, especially when I solder or do smaller works. Workbench is equipped with 2x40W fluorescent lamps, which give plenty of light. Drawer works smoothly, as it is mounted on ball bearing sliders. The only bad thing about drawer is it's size, it is always too small! ;-) Hey, but I can add second one any time I want, as modularity was part of original plan. Top shelf and board with hooks are also extremely helpful, everything according to my requirements. That is the best of all DIY projects - only thing that limits you is your imagination!</p>
